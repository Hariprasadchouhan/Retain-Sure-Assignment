```

## Review

- **Backend (`messy-migration/`)**:  
  - Separation of concerns is good: `app.py` (routes), `service.py` (business logic), `db.py` (database connection), `utils.py` (helpers), `init_db.py` (setup).
  - Database file (`users.db`) is in the same folder, which is fine for development.

- **Frontend/UI (`ui/`)**:  
  - UI code and templates are separated from backend.
  - Templates are organized in a dedicated folder.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Consider renaming `messy-migration` to `backend` or `api` for clarity.
- Move `users.db` to a `data/` or `instance/` folder if the project grows.
- Add a `static/` folder in `ui/` for CSS/JS if you expand the UI.
- Add a `tests/` folder for backend and frontend tests.
- Add a `requirements.txt` for both backend and UI.

## Conclusion

The current structure is good for a small project and meets separation of concerns.  
It is easy to navigate and maintain.  
For larger projects, consider the suggestions above.
